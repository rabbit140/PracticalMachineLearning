#Introduction
The aim of this project is to predict (*classify*) the manner in which subjects of [a study](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) exercised. To accomplish this, a model selection procedure was utilised and the best model was selected according to its accuracy.

#Analysis
##Data cleaning
Since both datasets contained many redundant columns containing little to no information (either "NA" vlaues or empty cells), these were removed to make the analysis and model fitting easier.
